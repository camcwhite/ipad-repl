# [Ruff REPL](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ruff-repl/id1594427551)

Ruff (Really Unnecessary and For Fun) REPL is a code REPL, Read Evaluate and Print Loop, 

This is a simple REPL for iPad/iPhone. Currently, Python 3 is the only supported language, but this will change in the future. If you have a request for a language or any questions, email me:

This app was built primarily to accompany my development workflow which uses an iPad with an Apple Magic Keyboard, so there are some shortcuts in the REPL:

  - Clear console: Option + 'K' (˚ character)
  - Previous command: Option + ';' (… character)
  - Next command: Option + '.' (≥ character)

That being said, things should work without an external keyboard and on an iPhone.

This app is open source! There is currently not an android version, so if you fork to release on android, all I ask for is credit.

Feel free to contact me (whiteceric@gmail.com) if you have any questions/requests.
